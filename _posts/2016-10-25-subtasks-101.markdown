Some tasks are more complicated than others and when working on something particularly complex it can be handy to make sure all components of a piece of work are addressed. Also checking things off a list is really, really satisfying. 

<br />

To enter check-offable subtasks in to a tasks description simply enter the list in this format: 

```
[ ] Subtask 1 
[ ] Subtask 2
[ ] Subtask 3
[ ] Subtask 4
```

They will then appear like this:

<br />

To check off tasks simply edit the description like this: 

```
[X] Subtask 1
[ ] Subtask 2
[ ] Subtask 3
[ ] Subtask 4
```

For the subtasks to appear like this:
