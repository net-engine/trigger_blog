Just a quick note to let you know that we’ve tweaked a few things in Trigger that we hope will save you those increasingly precious seconds.

First up, when entering a new task from the “create new” bar in the task view of a project you no longer need to reach all the way across to your mouse to click the “create” button. You are now able to save these details by pressing ctrl + enter on your keyboard.

Secondly, we spoke about our bookmarks feature recently and received some great feedback. In light of this we’ve made the process a little easier. Now once you have saved the name of your bookmark it will appear immediately in your bookmarks lists.

Finally, we’ve made a couple of changes to our milestones feature. Milestones now show in the order in which they were created with the newest first and we’ve also introduced a brand new “group by milestone” button. You can find this in the top right of the task view of a project.

Enjoy!

Team Trigger.
