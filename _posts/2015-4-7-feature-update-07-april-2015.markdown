As always we have been hard at work adding new features and improvements to Trigger. Our goal with these changes is to make Trigger easier than ever to use and get your work done!

## Schedule

Our new schedule view has received a lot of positive feedback (you can access the view here). On your schedule you can now make changes to days in the past (previously you could only update days in the future).

One of our planned features which we hope to release shortly will allow you to have more than one project on each day in your schedule.

## Task Pages

Every task has a description and we had several requests to allow everyone to see when a task description was updated and what changes were made.

Now when you update a task description you will see something like this:


## Custom Currency Symbol

We now allow custom currency symbols to be used in Trigger. You can now enter any character you would like to use for your currency symbol.


## Back to Last Search

At the top of task updates you will now see a “Back to Last Search Button” if you came to that page by a search.
