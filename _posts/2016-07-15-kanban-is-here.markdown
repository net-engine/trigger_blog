Incredibly simple and powerful, the Kanban page displays your tasks as cards placed in columns for each status. Allowing you to visualise your team workflow and become even more efficient.

In case you are not familiar, Kanban is a visualisation tool that enables you to optimise your workflow. It is one of the most (if not the most) used frameworks for those in agile development and has recently gained popularity within media companies, manufacturing and even investment banking.

To give it a spin just jump in to the task list for any of your projects and select the Kanban view.

Fun Fact: Kanban is literally signboard or billboard in Japanese so saying Kanban Board is kind of like saying ATM Machine
