We are proud to announce that you can now try Trigger free for 60 days, this is to give you time to really see the power and value of catching all logged time, and billing for it.

After speaking to agencies and teams that didn’t extend their 14 day trial we realised that they hadn’t seen or used 90% of the powerful timetracking, invoicing and reporting features that set Trigger apart from the ‘task management systems’ out there.

Trigger guides small businesses and teams, helping them keep the conversation in one place, time logged in context, and then at invoice time getting paid is a breeze.

We hope that by giving you 60 days, you’ll have a chance to get addicted to knowing where you’re at with all your projects and being more profitable, and your team the chance to see how Trigger can help you be more productive and get your work done.

There is no credit card required, and you can get [get started here!](www.triggerapp.com/signups/new)
